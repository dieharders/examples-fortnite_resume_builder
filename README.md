# examples-fortnite_resume_builder

This example grabs a user's publically available LinkedIn profile and formats the info as a resume matching Fortnite's design style. The webpage asks the user to allow the app access to their LinkedIn account and then proceeds to grab the 'Basic Profile' and 'Positions' fields available to developers.

**Note: Registered app developers now only have access to a user's Basic Profile data meaning only a subset of the entire profile is exposed (for example only the first position is returned). Only partnered (Paid) developers gain access to the rest of the info.

There are also Twitter and Facebook share buttons thrown in for fun.
