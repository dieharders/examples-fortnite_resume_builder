# Fortnite Resume Builder

![Preview](https://github.com/dieharders/examples-fortnite_resume_builder/blob/master/preview.jpg)

## [Try Live Demo](https://example-fortnite-resume.web.app/)
This example grabs a user's publically available Github profile and formats the info as a resume matching Fortnite's design style. The webpage asks the user to input their Github account and then proceeds to grab the profile details.

**Note: I have not included the large Fortnite font. If you would like to achieve the same look you can find an open source alternative or buy the font, it's called Burbank.

There are also Twitter and Facebook share buttons thrown in for fun.

# LinkedIn example is Deprecated
The branch used for LinkedIn v1 API no longer works. Since they introduced v2, LinkedIn has restricted access to user data returned to just a subset of what was accessible before. Since this project relied on fetching a user's work history, it no longer makes sense to maintain it moving forward without an Enterprise level subscription to LinkedIn.
